Description: Implements the Fuzzy Subjective Structure Model (FSSM), a hybrid 
    causal procedure for analyzing information behaviour in academic settings. 
    FSSM integrates PLS-SEM sufficiency paths, NCA necessity bottlenecks, and 
    cIPMA visualization with entropy weighting for subjective measurement and 
    generalized propensity score (GPS) weighting for causal balance. The package 
    formalizes four distinct causal claims, typical sufficiency, typical necessity, 
    probabilistic sufficiency, and probabilistic necessity. It supports both crisp 
    (binary threshold) and fuzzy (continuous membership) formulations.
